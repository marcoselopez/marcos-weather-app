# Marcos Lopez Weather App
This is a project created for a technical test for Recursiva.

## How to run
In the project directory, after open it, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the http://localhost:3000 URL to view it in your browser.

If the API Key is overthrown, you can generate a new Key on the API webpage and replace the "ApiKey" variable inside the "Main" component.

## How to visualize in a mobile device
After you run the application in the http://localhost:3000 URL, you can view in the browser of any mobile device connected to the same network as the PC where is running.
You need to check the PC IP Address and use that address, along with the PORT, to connect.

For example, if I'm running my app on a PC that uses the IP Adress of 10.0.0.30, on a mobile device, connected to the same network, I can write http://10.0.0.30:3000 on a browser to view the app.
